################ Construction, Analysis and Interface of an industrial mini Process #####################

Web page code is in the folder "website".

- The control part of the website is in the "user.php"-file. The javascript-part of the code is the actual ROS-communication.

- "session_censur.php" need to be changed for your own database implementation, and changed name to just "session.php".


NOTE: You might need to use hamachi since JS is a client based language therefore you will need to be on the same subnet as the computer connected to the manipulator.

All ROS code is included in the folder "ROS" we are using kinetic version
WARNING: These are also configured on the local computer, making it impossible to run as-is. But the important nodes and libraries used are here, such as "cpr_mover" and "rviz". Rosbridge is a requirement for processing outbound connections and turn it into ROS-code.
If you want to use our code as a base download the nodes from:
cpr_mover: https://github.com/CPR-Robots/cpr_mover 
rviz: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/tree/kinetic-devel
rosbridge: https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/tree/master

Our implementation for recieving outside data and controling the robot is "remote_controling/robot_pkg".

- main Node code is located in "remote_controling/robot_pkg/src/robot_communications/scripts/".

- "Plotter.py" script is history of joint movement.

- "get_joint_states.py" is where control message are recieved, tranformed, and sent to the manipulator node.

- "joint_movement.txt" is where the data for the plotter is stored.

- "mysql.connector" is the login details for the database, to ensure that we can upload manipulator data.
